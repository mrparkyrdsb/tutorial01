# Object Oriented Programming Note #1

Object Oriented Programming is awesome!

```python

# Example of a Class Definition in Python
class Person:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
       
    def __str__(self):
        return f"Person Object called: {self.name}"
```

## More Notes!
- ```class``` is a keyword in Python to create a class
- ```__init__()``` is a base override
